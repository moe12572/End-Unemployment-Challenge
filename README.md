# End-Unemployment-Challenge
This is my submission for the Refinery29 Coding Challenge. The project uses Next.js/React, TypeScript, and GraphQL to build a small application fetching data from the SpaceX API, displaying it in a responsive and visually appealing way. Hiring me = ðŸš€ Successful Launch

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Q/A Section
## Authentication Design

To handle authentication securely and at scale, we'll use services like AWS Amplify. It provides built-in features for multi-factor authentication, social logins, and secure user management, so we don't have to reinvent the wheel. For handling sessions, weâ€™d use JWT tokens, which are lightweight and work well with high-traffic apps. Encryption for user data, both in transit and at rest, will be prioritized for added security.

## Scalable Search Functionality

Search will be powered by efficient backend services like Elasticsearch ensuring fast, relevant results even at scale. On the frontend, weâ€™ll use techniques like input debouncing to reduce server load, and caching to improve performance. These tools help handle large amounts of data without sacrificing speed. If needed, AWS services like Elasticsearch can be used for seamless integration.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

For monitoring, weâ€™ll use Sentry to track errors and AWS CloudWatch to keep an eye on infrastructure health. Additionally, Mixpanel will help us understand user behavior and make informed improvements. With these tools, we'll ensure smooth operations and quickly catch any potential issues.
